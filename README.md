Most traffic signals in the US are still stuck in the 20th century. Advances in computer vision, mobile connectivity, and computing power could let us travel in the future, both more quickly and more safely for all of us, including bicyclists and pedestrians - so why arenâ€™t we? 

Recent advances in machine learning/computer vision now make it trivial to recognize and localize objects with basic off-the-shelf equipment, and compute and cellular data has also become cheaper and faster. The cost of upgrading an intersection with cameras should only be a few hundred dollars, and with more privacy-aware LiDAR a few thousand (and falling fast). This is an open source project created in the hopes of being able to affordably and effectively upgrade the US' traffic infrasture, as well as continuously improve it for years to come.
